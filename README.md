# Calculator
A simple, fully functional calculator, created without using any try/catch statements and utilizing Java &amp; Swing GUI

Created during my first Object-Oriented Programming Course in Spring 2022. (This project wasn't one of the projects assigned, but rather a personal one). 

I was really curious and wanted to see if I could use what I learned to pull it off. It took me some time thinking & planning out to get a working version.
